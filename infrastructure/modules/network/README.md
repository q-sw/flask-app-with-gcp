# Terraform Network Module

This module makes it easy to set up a new VPC Network in GCP by defining your network and subnet ranges in a concise syntax.

It supports creating:

- A Google Virtual Private Network (VPC)
- Subnets within the VPC
- Secondary ranges for the subnets (if applicable)

Sub modules are provided for creating individual vpc, subnets, and routes. See the modules directory for the various sub modules usage.

## Compatibility

This module is meant for use with Terraform 1.3+ and tested using Terraform 1.4+.
If you find incompatibilities using Terraform `>=1.3`, please open an issue.

If you haven't [upgraded][terraform-0.13-upgrade] and need a Terraform
0.12.x-compatible version of this module, the last released version
intended for Terraform 0.12.x is [2.6.0].

## Usage
You can go to the examples folder, however the usage of the module could be like this in your own main.tf file:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
    source  = "terraform-google-modules/network/google"
    version = "~> 7.1"

    project_id   = "<PROJECT ID>"
    network_name = "example-vpc"
    routing_mode = "GLOBAL"

    subnets = [
        {
            subnet_name           = "subnet-01"
            subnet_ip             = "10.10.10.0/24"
            subnet_region         = "us-west1"
        },
        {
            subnet_name           = "subnet-02"
            subnet_ip             = "10.10.20.0/24"
            subnet_region         = "us-west1"
            subnet_private_access = "true"
            subnet_flow_logs      = "true"
            description           = "This subnet has a description"
        },
        {
            subnet_name               = "subnet-03"
            subnet_ip                 = "10.10.30.0/24"
            subnet_region             = "us-west1"
            subnet_flow_logs          = "true"
            subnet_flow_logs_interval = "INTERVAL_10_MIN"
            subnet_flow_logs_sampling = 0.7
            subnet_flow_logs_metadata = "INCLUDE_ALL_METADATA"
        }
    ]

    secondary_ranges = {
        subnet-01 = [
            {
                range_name    = "subnet-01-secondary-01"
                ip_cidr_range = "192.168.64.0/24"
            },
        ]

        subnet-02 = []
    }

    routes = [
        {
            name                   = "egress-internet"
            description            = "route through IGW to access internet"
            destination_range      = "0.0.0.0/0"
            tags                   = "egress-inet"
            next_hop_internet      = "true"
        },
        {
            name                   = "app-proxy"
            description            = "route through proxy to reach app"
            destination_range      = "10.50.10.0/24"
            tags                   = "app-proxy"
            next_hop_instance      = "app-proxy-instance"
            next_hop_instance_zone = "us-west1-a"
        },
    ]
}
```

Then perform the following commands on the root folder:

- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build
- `terraform destroy` to destroy the built infrastructure

## Inputs

### Subnet Inputs

The subnets list contains maps, where each object represents a subnet. Each map has the following inputs (please see examples folder for additional references):

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| subnet\_name | The name of the subnet being created  | string | - | yes |

### Route Inputs

The routes list contains maps, where each object represents a route. For the next_hop_* inputs, only one is possible to be used in each route. Having two next_hop_* inputs will produce an error. Each map has the following inputs (please see examples folder for additional references):

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
